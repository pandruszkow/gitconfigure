#The ones below are also my idea, but a bit... unorthodox, I guess? Read on to discover why.

	#My workflow is generally the following:
	#1. Produce changes until satisfied with them.
	#2. Add all and commit/amend commit
	#3. Update origin/"master" and rebase/merge the current branch against that
	#4. `git push --force` against the remote feature branch. Unexpected remote changes just get overwritten.
	#   A feature is assumed to be only ever assigned to one developer only, so it makes sense that
	#   each feature branch on git is for one developer's exclusive use only, unless agreed otherwise
	#   with another developer.
	
	#This generally has two dangers in terms of data loss:
	#1. Another developer uploads code to your branch, your `push --force` overwrites it.
	#   This is arguably not your fault. Putting fingers into a running blender is not a good idea either.
	#   Git branches are free. If you want to keep it, put it in a branch and push it into a remote.
	#   As long as everybody understands this assumption, we should be clear.
	#2. You accidentally `push --force` into the "master" branch. Oops.
	#   The aliases below are designed to abort the push if the branch name looks like a "master" branch,
	#   precisely to prevent this scenario.
	
	#forcepush / upsync / upsub: check if branch is a master (name contains string 'master') or other 
	#protected branch. Abort if yes, push --force upstream if no.
	
#TODO: Refactor this monstrosity into proper Bash/shell/Perl/python scripts. Inline shell is not a good fit for this.
#TODO: Refactor this so that there's such a terminological concept as a per-branch "upstream". This is (respectively) a master, dev, or feature branch that you're currently focused on periodically rebasing against. Right now the code hardcodes a single convention-based string, and that's bad. You should be able to reconfigure this per-branch, or per-repo.
	
	#Forcepush and upsync are technically identical, but I keep them semantically different because
	#I'm using them for two distinct purposes. They both ring the terminal bell to indicate completion,
	#as a push operation may take a while.
	
	#A forcepush is meant to represent a forceful, 'I don't care' push into the remote branch, without regard
	#for what's already there, whether it's mine or not. The intended use is to to initiate a remote branch 
	#that mirrors whatever branch is checked out locally at the moment, and to unbreak a remote's history.

	#An upsync is meant to represent a push into a remote branch that is supposed to be exclusively writable to me.
	#It corresponds to step 3 of my workflow.
	#The "force" aspect of the `push --force` is purely a technical formality that comes out of being unable to
	#continue where the remote branch left off, if you are continuously rebasing against the "master" branch.

	#A downsync is an operation that ensures your local branch is in sync with whatever the upstream
	#"master" branch is, so that you can resolve any merge/rebase conflicts that may occur due to somebody
	#else changing the same pieces of code that you have.
	#Note 1: I prefer a rebase for now, but may switch to merge later on if I decide to do so.
